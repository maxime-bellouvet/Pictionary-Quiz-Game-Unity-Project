# Pictionary-Quiz-Game-Unity-Project
Local Multiplayer (1-6 teams) Pictionary Game.

## Build

Run the Pictionary.exe file to play the Game. Two different screens are preferable to fully enjoy the game. Indeed, one player will have to make other players guess a word (displayed on one screen only) that they must not look at. 

A new feature will be available soon for one-sreen use.

**FULL PROJECT COMING SOON.**
